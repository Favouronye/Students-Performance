Students Performance Analysis – Project Summary

This project analyzes students’ academic performance using a structured dataset containing math, reading, and writing scores alongside demographic and academic background variables. The goal is to identify key factors that influence student outcomes and present insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

The analysis focuses on the impact of test preparation courses, parental level of education, lunch type, and gender on students’ performance. Key performance indicators (KPIs) highlight the overall average scores: Math (72.0), Reading (74.9), and Writing (74.9). Comparative visualizations show that students who completed the test preparation course consistently achieved higher average scores across all subjects than those who did not.

Donut charts and bar charts were used to compare subject performance by test preparation status, while slicers allow users to filter results by gender, lunch type, and parental education level. These interactive elements make the dashboard easy to explore and suitable for non-technical stakeholders.

Overall, the project demonstrates how data visualization and analysis can uncover meaningful educational insights, support data-driven decision-making, and highlight the importance of preparatory programs in improving student academic performance.
